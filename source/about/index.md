[R&eacute;mi Carton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/remicarton/)

> I have nothing but kind words to say about Samuel. He is a diligent and self-driven worker that is capable of planning and executing complex tasks on his own. His communication is excellent and is easy to understand and bounce ideas off of. He was enjoyable to have in Slack and he has a well-cultured sense of humor! He was instrumental in the creation of an MVP SaaS platform and I would absolutely hire him again for future projects. 10/10!
